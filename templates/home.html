              Early in the morning, our baker Austin Hall
              would come in, rake out the coals and bake bread
              for the day. This bread became a part of Roman’s at

            We expanded bread production to our own space in Greenpoint,

            to take home at Marlow & Daughters, Stranger Wines, Roman’s,
            and Achilles Heel, as well as at nine NYC Greenmarkets.
